# Los.Santos.Dope.Wars

This mod re-adds drug trafficking mini-missions that were scrapped during GTA5 development. I've inspired myself on GTA:Chinatown Wars drug dealing mechanics. There are multiple drug dealers found around Los Santos and Blaine County. They restock every night and their prices change. You can make a good profit by buying low and selling high.
